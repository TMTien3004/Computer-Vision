# Computer-Vision
A collection of smaller Computer Vision projects using Python and OpenCV library. This project consists of three smaller projects:
- Virtual Volume Controller
- Virtual Painter
- Virtual Mouse Clicker

## Virtual Volume Controller
### Features
You can control your volume by using your index and thumb fingers.
### Instructions
The distance between your index and thumb fingers will change the volume of your computer. In other words, pinching your index and thumb fingers will lower the volume, and vice versa.


## Virtual Painter
### Features
You can draw and erase simple lines on your camera with three colors: purple, blue, and green.
### Instructions
Use your index finger to draw. Whenever you need to erase or change color, raise only your index and middle finger and hover over the tool you need to use.
